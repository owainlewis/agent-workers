# Content Pillars

Five pillars. Each one feeds a specific offer.

## AI Coding (25%)

How to use AI tools to write real software. Claude Code, Cursor, Codex, agentic workflows, coding faster with AI.

**Audience:** Engineers who code daily and want to ship faster.
**Feeds:** Skool (engineers want configs, setups, workflows)

**Problems we solve:**
- Setting up Claude Code properly (CLAUDE.md, settings, hooks, skills)
- Running multiple agents on real projects
- Debugging with AI without losing control
- Knowing when to prompt vs when to code manually

## AI Engineering (20%)

Building AI-powered systems for production. Agents, RAG, evals, MCP, PydanticAI, system design, architecture.

**Audience:** Intermediate-to-senior engineers building AI products.
**Feeds:** Skool (engineers want architecture blueprints, code repos)

**Problems we solve:**
- Building agents that work reliably, not just in demos
- Production patterns for RAG, evals, and monitoring
- Choosing the right architecture for the problem
- Moving from prototype to deployed system

## AI for Business (30%)

How AI applies to real businesses. Automation systems, workflow design, "I built this for a real business" walkthroughs.

**Audience:** Business owners (£100k+) who know AI matters but don't know where to start.
**Feeds:** Build Academy (they watch and think "I need that for my business")

**Problems we solve:**
- Identifying which processes to automate first
- Building AI systems that actually save time (not just demos)
- Understanding what's possible without being technical
- Connecting AI tools to real workflows (support, content, reporting)

## Business (15%)

Software engineering career, freelancing, pricing, going solo, revenue, the one-person business model.

**Audience:** Engineers considering independence + business owners evaluating AI investment.
**Feeds:** Gradient Work + Build Academy

**Problems we solve:**
- How to price AI consulting and development work
- Building a solo business around AI skills
- The real economics of hiring developers vs AI-assisted building
- Going from employed to independent

## AI Tools (10%)

New models, tool reviews, honest comparisons, what's actually useful. Timely, opportunistic content.

**Audience:** Everyone interested in AI — broadest reach.
**Feeds:** Top of funnel — grows subscribers and email list

**Problems we solve:**
- Cutting through hype to find what actually works
- Comparing tools honestly (not sponsored reviews)
- Understanding new releases and what they mean for real work
