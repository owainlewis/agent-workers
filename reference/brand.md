# Brand

**Owain Lewis.** 20 years software engineering. Former Director of Engineering. Now solo — building AI systems for clients, teaching business owners to implement AI, documenting everything on YouTube.

**Positioning:** The experienced engineer in a market full of automation influencers and AI hype merchants. Everyone else teaching "AI for business" either learned the tools last year or is selling templates without understanding what breaks in production.

**The line:** "The tools are free. The judgement isn't."

## Voice

Clear. Confident. Builder-first. Talk like a senior engineer explaining something to a sharp friend — not a guru selling dreams.

**Sound like this:**
- "Here's how I built X"
- "This is what's actually working"
- "I've been using X and it's working really well. Here's the setup."
- "Not everything needs this. Small stuff I still just do the simple way."

**Don't sound like this:**
- "This changes everything" / "Game-changer" / "Mind-blowing"
- "There's a better way." (infomercial)
- "Here's the bigger picture." (keynote)
- "You won't believe what happened next."

**Rules:**
1. One idea per paragraph.
2. Cut the warm-up. Don't start with "In this post, I'm going to explain..."
3. Active voice. Direct. No hedging.
4. Show the thing before explaining why it matters.
5. Talk about what you do, not what they should do. First person.
6. Don't name your frameworks. Describe what you do.
7. Simple and clear beats polished and impressive.
