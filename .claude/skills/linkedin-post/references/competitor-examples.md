Posts from other creators. Study the language simplicity, NOT the formatting. Our posts don't use emojis, checkmarks, or heavy visual formatting. But these creators nail simple language.

## What to learn from these

1. **Word choice** — "You don't need to write the code; you just manage the agents that write it." No jargon. A 12-year-old could understand it.
2. **Setup before the list** — Chris always explains why the list matters before giving it. "But AI has eliminated the need for all that." Then the list.
3. **Math as proof** — Making abstract claims concrete with numbers: "3k/mo x 28 clients = 1m"
4. **Reframing familiar concepts** — "You now no longer need to know coding to code." Takes something everyone knows and flips it.
5. **Short sentence authority** — "Happy customers and word of mouth is, and always will be, the best marketing." Reads like something your dad would say. That's the point.

## What NOT to copy

- Emoji bullets and section headers
- Checkmark lists
- Arrow symbols as formatting
- Product promotion woven into every post
- "Save this sheet" engagement bait
- PDF giveaway CTAs

<example title="AI business blueprint">
90% of startup tasks can be automated by AI (Harvard)

Here's how to build a $1M business by yourself:

2 years ago, start-ups required:

- A team of 50
- Millions in VC funding
- A fancy office in San Francisco

But AI has eliminated the need for all that.

Today, you can start a business with:

- Zero employees
- A laptop and a good wifi connection
- Knowledge of the right AI tools

There is almost no barrier to entry at this point in time.

All you have to do is follow these steps

1. Spot the Pain
Find a boring pain point (repetitive, costly, ignored).
Map out the workflow: inputs, steps, outputs.

1. Start as a Service
Do the job manually as a productised service.
Prove demand before automation. Charge from day one.

1. Choose Your Business Model

Productised Services
Cohorts/Courses
SaaS/Micro-tools
Templates/Digital Assets

4. Build a Marketing Engine

Find pain points with Listen Labs and AI research.
Build a site and create content.
Use Clay and Mutiny to personalise content.
Track traffic and mentions.

5. Create an Operations OS
Rule: If it repeats, automate.
If it needs judgement, template.

6. Sales Engine
Follow this pipeline: Capture, Qualify, Nurture, Close, Expand.

Then follow one of these formulas:

3k/mo x 28 clients = 1m
1k product x 84/month = 1m
199 SaaS x 420 subs = 1m

(With the math laid out like that, it's not as daunting !)

We're entering the era of 1-person, AI-powered businesses,
Which makes this a golden age for founders.

<example title="Claude Code explainer">
There is a reason everyone is talking about Claude Code.
It is the most powerful AI tool available.
This is the full breakdown you need to understand it:

You now no longer need to know coding to code.

You don't need to write the code; you just manage the agents that write it.

People are building some incredible apps and websites using it in a couple of hours max.

Which is pretty crazy, all things considered. Yet another seismic moment.

However, if you don't know where to start, it can be a tiny bit confusing.

Which is why I've created this all-in-one guide,
Aiming to get you up to speed in just a couple of minutes:

So, what is Claude Code?

It's a command-line tool built by Anthropic that sits inside your terminal and works across your entire workflow.

Next, what is the optimal workflow?

Start in plan mode
Write your goal clearly
Let Claude break it into steps
Review and iterate the plan
Switch to auto-accept edits mode
Claude executes the plan end-to-end
Review output, refine if needed

The key is a good plan. Without that, you'll get tons of revision rounds.

But what can you actually use Claude Code for as a founder?

1. Synthesise customer feedback
2. Draft documents and presentations
3. Build code and prototypes
4. Research and competitive analysis
5. Automate repetitive workflows
6. Create reusable skills

Plus many more. Like I said, people are building full websites and apps with this.

What are the Power Features worth knowing about?

1. MCP (Model Context Protocol)
This is like a USB-C for AI - one interface for your entire tool stack.

2. Skills (Reusable Automations)
These are task-specific instruction packages Claude auto-loads when relevant.

3. CLAUDE.md (Project Memory)
A markdown file that gives Claude permanent context about your project.

<example title="AI agents vs agentic AI">
AI Agents and Agentic AI are not the same thing.

Your competitors already know the difference:

There are actually 3 major types of AI workflows you need to know.

Each one fills a slightly different gap in your business.

Non-Agentic AI
Basic prompt-response AI with no memory or reasoning.

How it works:
User types a single prompt, model processes.
Generates a direct response immediately.
Interaction ends with no context retention.

Agentic AI
A self-managing AI system that can plan and execute.

How it works:
The system breaks your goal into sub-tasks.
Connects to tools, APIs, data sources.
Evaluates results with feedback loops.

AI Agent
Single-task AI worker designed to automate one task.

How it works:
User defines one clear responsibility.
Agent receives inputs, accesses connected tools.
Executes and outputs without guidance.

AI Agents perform single-task automation.
Agentic AI is for multi-step problem solving.

<example title="marketing priorities">
Marketing teams waste thousands chasing trends...

But ignore the only thing that really matters:

Having a great product.

It's the foundation of marketing.

Happy customers and word of mouth is, and always will be, the best marketing.

If you can develop your MVP and get real feedback from real users...

They will become your product champions for life.

If you want compound growth, you need to prioritise your marketing properly.

Here's what to focus on, in order:

The Surface Level (what people focus on first)
Goal: Get attention fast.

AI tools and automations.
New channels and formats.
Virality and reach tactics.
Shiny tool stacks.

What actually happens:
Short-term traffic spikes.
Results depend on algorithms.
Growth remains unpredictable.

What Starts To Work
Goal: Create consistent high-quality output.

Content calendars.
Regular posting cadence.
Repurposing workflows.
Personal brands as distribution.

What Actually Matters
Goal: Generate qualified demand and conversions.

Clear ICP and positioning.
Sales and content alignment.
Intent signals over impressions.

What Never Changes
Goal: Build long-term leverage.

Product that delivers a clear outcome.
One defined audience.
Strong value proposition.
Simple, repeatable offer.

Don't waste time on surface-level tactics if your product still needs work.

A viral post won't help if you don't have a clear ICP.

Start at the foundation and work your way up.

<example title="new SEO">
If you want your brand to stay visible in 2026...

Don't follow the Old SEO rules.

Traditional SEO hasn't died, like some creators are saying.

But the game has changed and the requirements for discovery have expanded.

Millions of people are using LLMs instead of (or alongside) Google for search.

Embracing the new era of search with AI is a non-negotiable.

Old SEO
A race to the top of Google's page one.

Built on keywords, backlinks, and technical tweaks.
It worked, but prioritised visibility over real authority.

Great for:
Driving large volumes of traffic.
Helping new sites compete quickly.

Potential problems:
Results vanish when algorithms update.
Traffic without trust or conversions.
No presence in AI-driven platforms where discovery now happens.

New SEO
SEO today is about being retrieved, cited, and trusted, across Google and AI platforms.

It's built in 4 layers:
GEO: Cited in LLMs like ChatGPT and Gemini.
AEO: Appearing in AI summaries and overviews.
AIO: Structuring data so AI tools and workflows can use it.
SXO: Aligning UX, trust, and conversions with user intent.

Great for:
Building durable authority that compounds over time.
Being cited in AI-driven results and recommendations.
Turning visibility into leads, sales, and long-term trust.

This isn't about choosing between Google and ChatGPT.
The new game is being adaptable and meeting your customers where they are.
