# LinkedIn Content Strategy

## Content Buckets

80% of posts must fall within three buckets. The LinkedIn algorithm semantically matches your content to your profile — staying on-topic is how it knows who to distribute to.

1. **Practical AI Skills** (40%) — How to use AI tools to do real work. Broadest appeal — top-of-funnel.
2. **Become Irreplaceable** (30%) — Opinionated content about what matters in the age of AI. Turns viewers into followers.
3. **Deep Technical** (30%) — Production AI engineering, real builds, architecture. Converts engineers.

## Content Funnel

Every post serves one purpose. Tag each post before writing.

| Type | % | Purpose |
|------|---|---------|
| **Awareness** | ~30% | Broad reach, attract new followers |
| **Education** | ~50% | Saves and follows, build authority |
| **Conversion** | ~20% | Turn followers into customers |

## Save-Optimized Content

The algorithm prioritizes saves over likes. Design education posts so people bookmark them:

- Configs and setups they can copy
- Step-by-step guides for a specific outcome
- Architecture diagrams or system breakdowns
- Cheat sheets and comparisons
- Before/after with the exact steps between

## Cadence

7 posts per week. Template (swap days as needed):

| Day | Bucket | Funnel | Format |
|-----|--------|--------|--------|
| Mon | Practical AI Skills | Education | Carousel |
| Tue | Deep Technical | Education | Carousel |
| Wed | Practical AI Skills | Awareness | Text post |
| Thu | Become Irreplaceable | Education | Carousel |
| Fri | Any | Awareness | Text post |
| Sat | Deep Technical | Conversion | Text post |
| Sun | Practical AI Skills | Education | Short video |

## Idea Sources

1. **Work log** — What you built, fixed, automated this week
2. **YouTube repurposing** — Each video = 3-5 posts from different angles
3. **Outlier scan** — What's getting 5-10x engagement for similar creators
4. **Tool releases** — Test on a real project, post the honest result
5. **Questions and comments** — Each question is a post
6. **Client work** — Every project is 3+ posts
7. **Contrarian takes** — What you disagree with

## Repeatable Formats

- "I tested [tool] on a real project" (awareness)
- "My exact setup for [skill]" — carousel (education)
- "[Tool A] vs [Tool B] — honest comparison" (education)
- "The AI workflow that replaced [manual task]" (education)
- "[New tool] just dropped. Here's what's useful." (awareness)
- "What 20 years of engineering taught me about [topic]" (awareness)
- "I automated [task]. [New time] instead of [old time]." (conversion)

## Formats

Two formats. Don't add a third.

- **Carousels** — for education. Highest follower conversion.
- **Short video** (60-90 seconds) — screen recordings of real work.

Text posts work for awareness/opinion but don't drive saves or follows like carousels and video.
